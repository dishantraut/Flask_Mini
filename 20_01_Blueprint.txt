# Flask Blueprint | Blueprint :-
- As your code grows, it can become harder for you to maintain everything in a single file.

- So, when your application grows in size or complexity, you may want to structure your code 
  in a different way to keep it maintainable and clear to understand
  
- help you structure your Flask application by grouping its functionality into reusable components.

- Flask takes care of dispatching incoming requests to the correct view based on the request URL 
  and the routes you’ve defined.
  
- Flask Blueprints encapsulate functionality, such as views, templates, and other resources

- Each Flask Blueprint is an object that works very similarly to a Flask application

- They both can have resources, such as static files, templates, and views that are associated with routes.

- However, a Flask Blueprint is not actually an application

- It needs to be registered in an application before you can run it

- When we register a Flask Blueprint in an application, 
  we’re actually extending the application with the contents of the Blueprint.
  
- They record operations to be executed later when you register them on an application
